# Jwitter

## React x Firebase x TypeScript

- This is a clone coding of Twitter for test/practice Firebase's real time database.
- This project is realized basically by Firebase, React(with CRA, Hooks, styled-components) and TypeScript.
- I've just started to practice TS instead of JS because of the thing that I can catch errors before compiling and wouldn't need to use PropTypes.
- So, i think that TS is a good superset of JS, which could compensate weak point of JS.

## Routes

- [x] Auth.tsx : Route for authentication of user
- [x] Home.tsx : Main page - Functionalities CRUD of "Jweet"
- [x] Profile.tsx : Read/Update user information & LogOut

## Authentication

- [x] Email
- [x] Google
- [x] Github

## Add Styled-Components && Global Styles

- I prefere use Styled-Component because memorizing each class name would be hard when a project become big.
- So, I can put global style with Global Styles and put detail style in each route & component.

## Jweeter or Jwitter?

- Actually, it was my mistake but i decided to use this mistake.
- This JS project name is "Jweeter" and it will be change on "Jwitter" when I republish this project with TypeScript.

## Functionality to add

- [ ] Log in as client public
- [ ] Button for leaving & deleting user information : Profile.js
