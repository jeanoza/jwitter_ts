# Jweeter

## React x Firebase x TypeScript

- This is a clone coding of Twitter for test/practice Firebase's real time database.
- This project is realized basically by Firebase, React(with CRA, Hooks, styled-components) and TypeScript.
- I've just started to practice TS instead of JS because of the thing that i can catch errors before compiling and wouldn't need to use PropTypes.
- So, i think that TS is a good superset of JS, which could compensate weak point of JS.

## Routes

- [ ] Auth.tsx : Route for authentication of user
- [ ] Home.tsx : Main page - Functionalities CRUD of "Jweet"
- [ ] Profile.tsx : Read/Update user information & LogOut
